# Compare loans with various interest rates

The Programming exercise is asking me to rewrite programming exercise 5.21 and create a GUI that has an example picture
to show how exactly I need to program it to look like. The program needs to allow you need enter the loan amount and loan period
in number of years from a text field, and it should display monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from 5 percent to 8 percent, with increments of one-eighth in the text area. Basically, the assignment wants me to program a GUI that calculates loans with interest rates from exercise 5.21

## Example Output

This image will display as your example output. Name the image README.jpg in your project folder.

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.
Well, I analyzed the requirements by simply reading the text in the pearson and looking at the images provided in the pearson
to get a good look on how the program should be layed out and what it needs to be doing. All the information needed to recognize a solution
is available in the pearson text. Which is basically create a GUI out programming exercise 5.21 and let the user
calculate loan interest rates.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
